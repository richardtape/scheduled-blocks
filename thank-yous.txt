Everyone (apart from me, obviously. Thanking myself would be weird. Self Five!) who
has donated time, patience, brain capacity, code, design, care, and love to the
WordPress.org project. Including Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg for kicking the
whole thing off.

Everyone who has worked on Gutenberg. I truly believe it's the future of not just
WordPress, but content management systems.
